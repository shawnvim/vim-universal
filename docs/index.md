# Intro

The VIM Universal is a universal Vim integration with multiple open source plug-ins.

Vim is an excellent terminal based text editor. The one problem with Vim is that it doesn’t function the same way as the regular graphical editors. You must know basic Vim commands in order to start using it. If you want to use it more effectively, you need to master the keyboard shortcuts and have some basic knownledge about the configuration.

In this tutorial, I will show you how to make Vim as great as it should be, and help you experience the VIM Universal because it’s painful without configuration.
