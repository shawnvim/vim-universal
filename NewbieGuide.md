Newbie Guide
=======
 - This is a functional guide to help newcomers get started quickly.  
 - Only **a few** functions are introduced here, and it is better to check the specific introduction of the corresponding plug-in in [`/pack`](https://github.com/shawnvim/vim-universal/tree/master/pack) to get more detailed information.  
 - Tips:  
 `<Leader>` is set as **space bar** by default  
 `<Ctrl-R><Ctrl-W>` for a quick copy from **current word** to command line
